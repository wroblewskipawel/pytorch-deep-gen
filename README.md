Collection of deep generative models in PyTorch

This repository was created for exploration of deep generative models with main focus being put on adversarial generative networks.

At this moment models based on following papers were implemented:
* [Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196)

* [Learning Texture Manifolds with the Periodic Spatial GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06566)

* [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)

Experiments that can be found inside [jupyter notebooks](./notebooks/) are mainly based on CIFAR10 and [Describable Textures Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/).

This repository is curently in active development.
